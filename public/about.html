<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Passionate about web development, I was sparked to enter the field
  by a drive to think differently. A proud achievement involves creating
   a web development project. Problem-solving involves thoughtful consideration
    and collaborative discussions. My skills include proficiency in HTML,
     CSS, JS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SQL, and Java. Continuous improvement
      is fueled by a desire to become a better person.</p>

<p>While waiting for collaboration opportunities, I actively seek knowledge
   from the internet. I contribute to teamwork by showcasing expertise, as
    seen in a reverse KT presentation in a new project. Leadership aspirations
     include comprehensive understanding of how every application works.</p>
